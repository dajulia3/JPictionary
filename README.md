JPictionary
===========

Multiplayer Pictionary over the network implemented in Java. Especially fun with a tablet pc! To play, first run the server, then either run clients locally or have your friends connect to your server.
This repo contains the entire Netbeans project.
Project from 2010, so certain things might be a little out of date by today's standards. We used to use svn for its VCS back in the day.
